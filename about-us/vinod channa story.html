            <h2 style="font-size: clamp(1.2rem, 2.5vw + 1rem, 1.7625rem);">As a kid, people used to call me “sukda” all
                the time. It was frustrating, and honestly, it started
                affecting how I saw myself. I was underweight, sick most of the time, barely eating, and just didn’t
                have the kind of support or environment that encouraged a healthy lifestyle. On top of that, I wasn’t
                working
                at the time, and the pressure from my family only made things harder—I lost my appetite and even more of
                my
                confidence. Looking at me back then, no one—myself included—could’ve imagined I’d ever build a strong,
                muscular
                body. But somewhere deep down, I knew I didn’t want to stay that way forever. I didn’t have all the
                answers,
                but I had the will to change.

                    “Tere jaisa phakut nahi khaata huun main (I don’t sit idle and work to earn my livelihood unlike
                    you)” retorted my younger brother once when I asked him about the refrigerator that he bought first
                    time at home. He used to work in Medical Shop and spent most of his salary for daily chores. “You
                    don’t even earn half your younger brother’s income and contribute nothing for household necessities”
                    scolded my mother. I was speechless and confused. That was one of the worst night that I remember
                    when I felt completely abandoned and hopeless in front of my family. That insult made me numb that
                    night and I sulked down into my bed with heavy heart and could not stop cursing my miserable
                    situation. I got up in the morning with misty eyes and tears running down my cheeks and ran out of
                    my house with empty stomach just to look for a quick-payment job to compensate for the discomfort I
                    had caused to my family.

                    removed from this job because I missed to salute once to my Employer. After this, I tried for desk

                    All these was so frustrating that I could not understand what is happening with my life. One thing

            <h2 class="font-weight">Even though money was tight and I didn’t have a stable job, I never gave up on my
                dream of becoming a top bodybuilder. I was hungry to learn. Every article or conversation about fitness
                pushed me to dig
                deeper and understand more.

            <h2 class="font-weight">
                I worked part-time and studied at night college just to support myself. That’s when I found a local gym
                for ₹50 a month and began training seriously. I also started reaching out to professional bodybuilders
                for advice and realized how important proper nutrition was. Most of my salary went into my diet which
                included eggs, bananas, and whatever my body needed even if it meant upsetting my family sometimes.
                Slowly, my body began to change. I trained hard, entered competitions, and kept pushing myself. It
                wasn’t easy, but I knew all of this was preparing me for something bigger and I refused to quit.</h2>

                Although there was improvement in my body structure and skills, I realized there was no change in my
                income or it was very fluctuating. For a month, I would earn 20k to 50k and for the next 2 months I’d
                have empty pockets. I used to literally plead other trainers to buy in some clients for personal
                training. Sometimes, I was not able to afford my basic needs such as petrol, dietary requirements and
                personal gym-wears.</h2>

            <h2 class="font-weight">When these miserable circumstances were unbearable, I used to sit at Siddhivinayak
                temple to bring peace to my mind and pray for good things. Despite repeated failures, I had no answers
                when my parents and
                younger brother urged me to leave this path and take up a job with a stable income. Even with deep
                disappointment and just a faint glimmer of hope, I chose to stay committed to my profession, determined
                to work harder and make something meaningful out of it.

                Talwalkars, earning ₹4000 per month—my highest salary at the time. Coming from poverty and a vernacular
                background, I initially struggled to adjust to the posh environment and fluent English speakers, often
                studying with a dictionary to keep up. Over time, I went on to win prestigious titles like Mr. Mumbai

        <div class="div_1">
            <h2 class="font-weight">
                To deepen my understanding of fitness, I personally experimented with various exercises, diets, and
                supplements to observe how my body responded. My sports background helped me adapt quickly and refine my
                techniques. As I progressed, coaching skills started to come to me naturally. I made it a point to study
                each client’s health profile in detail—focusing on aspects like age, BMI, body fat percentage, and
                overall functioning. While plenty of information was available in books and videos, I could never truly
                believe in a method unless I had tested it myself. This habit significantly boosted my confidence when
                training clients or recommending dietary supplements. Whenever I encountered a new form of exercise, I
                was restless until I had mastered it only then did I feel confident enough to teach it to others. This
                personal benchmark helped me build trust with clients and gain a reputation as a sought-after personal
                trainer. It wasn’t an easy journey. I left no stone unturned in exploring every exercise that could
                benefit my clients or my own growth. To further strengthen my professional skills, I earned my
                certification from K-11 Academy.

                <p>I decided to shift to Bandra or Andheri as there was more scope of personal training due to the TV
                    and film crowd residing there and their profession always demanded to look good. I inquired and got
                    an opportunity to work as freelance Personal Trainer in Sykz gym at Bandra. While I was dedicating
                    myself completely in improving on new and different workout techniques and dietary supplements for
                    my clients, one of my client recommended my name to Ritesh Deshmukh who joined my personalized
                    training program to get sculpted body for his upcoming movie House full 1. This was when I got my
                    first break to train a celebrity and an opportunity to prove myself as an Effective trainer in the
                    film industry. Ritesh was quite happy and satisfied with my training results and further suggested
                    his House-Full 1 team crew to join my personal training. Ritesh even insisted me to assist him with
                    his world tour plan for constant coaching and guidance. This was really surprise to me as I used to
                    just wish if I can only go to any country for vacation one day and here I was going on world tour.
                    Another pleasant surprise was when I met Amitabh Bachchan on this tour and he referred to me as
                    ‘Sir’ when I was coaching for some exercise. This was the biggest moment of my life. After that,
                    there was no looking back.</p>

                    camp for 1 day which I felt more like an honor. There was a mixed feeling of happiness and bitter

                    A plot against me</h2>
                <p style="color: #5F727F;">I joined Gold Gym as the skyz gym was shut. I was at good start of my
                    body-building career, I joined
                    Freelance Personal trainer where my caliber was noticed more frequently. Many high-profile builders
                    used to approach me for tips and appreciate my efforts and training method. I noticed that there was
                    a fan following atmosphere at this gym which I thoroughly relished and did my best to help others
                    with their expectations. However, little did I know that I was indirectly becoming a hurdle for
                    other trainers in this Gym and their reputations as most of their clients were also coming to me for
                    coaching. Unfortunately, I had to leave Gold Gym as there were complaints against me from all other
                    trainers on irrational grounds.</p>

                <p style="color: #5F727F;">While I was training at Gold's gym, I suffered from jaundice and malaria and
                    due to a result of long
                    travelling hours for 8 hours a day on bike made my back stiff and aggravated my back problems and
                    lead to slip disc. The condition was so worse that I could not get up from the chair on my own.I was
                    totally dependant on others just to get up, 24*7 it's a killing pain, its worst condition where you
                    are so helpless and medication also cannot help you and you just have to bear each second.Pain
                    killer is the only solution that too was a temporary relief. My profession was full of movements and
                    I could not do anything and still my livelihood was not so good that I could rest.I used to come to
                    the Gym wearing a belt with an assistant trainer to continue with my training. Many suggested me to
                    take rest but it was too small a sacrifice for me to reach my goal I thought. I was ready to take
                    pain, sweat, workload and put- in as much efforts but could not lose even a single opportunity to
                    grow at any cost as this was my peak of the career and was highest paid trainer. I was so occupied
                    with my daily training and handling multiple clients from morning at 6 am till 10 pm in the night
                    that my exposure to sunlight kept on decreasing and I suffered from Vitamin D and Calcium
                    deficiency.I could have still continued with all these problems, however I was unable to take the
                    misbehavior of the management at Gold's gym I had left Gold's gym. </p>

                <p style="color: #5F727F;">As a result of my own experience with back pain, conditional diseases and
                    observation of various
                    lifestyle diseases, I realized that only working on strength (which is required in body building is
                    not enough or complete fitness). Fitness is vast, I need to learn different fitness techniques to
                    reach complete fitness. The new time-bound and individual-based approach is required to address
                    lifestyle discomforts of my clients by studying their work background, its effects on their body and
                    assigning them unique suitable forms of exercise. For example, an individual with a desk job is more
                    likely to suffer from back pain, incorrect postures pain, heart diseases due to lack of body
                    movement. I used to design an exercise regimen with mixture of different types of fitness
                    techniques. As we are in constantly changing and dynamic environment, the need of the hour is to
                    learn and adopt different types of workouts that suits best to our work-body-lifestyle pattern and
                    bring in new forms of training with enthusiastic vigor and positive attitude instead of failing
                    ourselves with strict set of exercise goals. All these can be achieved from different fitness
                    techniques like strength with weight training, flexibility with dynamic and static stretches and
                    yoga, speed and agility from functional training, parkour, gymnastic, callisthenics and other such
                    training. There are other conditioning and balancing techniques achieved from gadget training like
                    TRX, Bosuball, Swiss Ball, Kettle bell etc. was clear that I cannot work like this without
                    fulfilling my ambition to change my body and status.

            Every person has their own struggle or experiences in life which leads them to draw their own conclusion and
            belief systems. Based on my experience with negative and positive extremities in life, I have come to
            believe
            that the intense struggle makes you more responsible, constant hardships prepares you to deal with any
            situation
            and your unbroken spirit to prove yourself in life not only brings out the best but matures you enough to
