                    attitude. He never praises more than required for someone outperforming as per his or her potential
                    or undermines anyone’s ability if someone fails to perform basic workout. This comes from his belief
                    of equality in terms of healthy society. Vinod Channa can be best described as ‘A Man of result’
                    more suitably rather than ‘A Man of words’ which implies to the fact that he always strives and
                    makes their client realize the efforts required towards achieving the desired body types rather than
                    just loose or promising talks. He strongly believes and promotes the fact that each individual

                    from the fact that his work satisfaction comes
                    from his client’s achievement of their desired body type and fulfilling their expectations to the
                    core.</div>
